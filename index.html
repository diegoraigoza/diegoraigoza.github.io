            <p class = "middle">I studied math and computer science in my community college, IVC. There was a lack of emphasis for the STEM field, but I pushed for it either way. Over the course of my education, I did a couple of projects on my own. I tried building a vending machine, a rehash of Mad Libs, moving sprites, and learning other languages on my own. Most of the inspiration came from my father. He pushed me towards my passion for math and computer science. My father is the perfect role model for me because he puts all of his hard work and effort into teaching. He taught me to work harder than the bare minimum. <br />
